# EchoPress

EchoPress is a portable, installer-driven platform for independent artists. Upload it, run the web wizard, and launch a fully brandable site—albums, playlists, blog, contact, newsletter, analytics embed—without touching code.

## Highlights
- **Web installer** at `/install/` (or CLI via `php installer/install.php`).
- **SQLite or MySQL** storage via PDO.
- **Built-in newsletter** with SMTP, PHP `mail()`, or webhook delivery.
- **Analytics embed** UI for pasting Google/Matomo/Plausible snippets.
- **Bundled FFmpeg** so audio encoding works even on locked-down hosts.
- **Portable docroot** (`web/`) ready for any cPanel/VPS deployment.

See `INSTALL.txt` for step-by-step setup instructions and `web/README.md` for detailed platform docs.
